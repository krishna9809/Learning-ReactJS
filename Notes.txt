package.json is configuration for npm

there is 2 types of dependices

1. dev dependices ->
2. normal dependencies -> used in production also

when we install any dev dependencies we will install it like --> npm -D 

so here we are installing percel as dev dependencies --> npm install -D parcel 

diff between package.json vs package-lock.json

package.json keep update the version and it is the configuration of npm
package-lock.json keep the track of Exact the which version is installed of all the dependecies'
