package.json is configuration for npm

there is 2 types of dependices

1. dev dependices ->
2. normal dependencies -> used in production also

when we install any dev dependencies we will install it like --> npm -D 

so here we are installing percel as dev dependencies --> npm install -D parcel 

diff between package.json vs package-lock.json

package.json keep update the version and it is the configuration of npm
package-lock.json keep the track of Exact the which version is installed of all the dependecies'

to host App on Server use -> npx parcel index.html

npm --> just install the packages
npx --> excute package

1st way to use react --> cdn --> this is not a prefer way
2nd way to use react --> npm

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

import js as module
<script type="module" src="App.js"></script>
